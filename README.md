### MyInfoHelper

Helper to get a V3 MyInfo person. Because our project only requires the person basic object, we have only written `getPersonBasic` method. Contributions for `getPerson` are welcomed.

`import { MyInfo } from "singpass-myinfo-oidc-helper"`

### Login

- `constructAuthorizationUrl = (state: string, nonce?: string) => string` - constructs the authorization url with the necessary params, including the:

- state (later returned in redirectUri)
- nonce (later returned inside the JWT from token endpoint)

- `getTokens (authCode: string, axiosRequestConfig?: AxiosRequestConfig) => Promise<TokenResponse>` - get back the tokens from SP token endpoint. Outputs TokenResponse, which is the input for getIdTokenPayload
- `getIdTokenPayload(tokens: TokenResponse) => Promise<TokenPayload>` - decrypt and verify the JWT. Outputs TokenPayload, which is the input for extractNricAndUuidFromPayload
- `extractNricAndUuidFromPayload(payload: TokenPayload) => { nric: string, uuid: string }` - finally, get the nric and WOG (Whole-of-government) UUID of the user from the ID Token TokenPayload

#### Logout Singpass SSO session

- `logoutOfSession(sessionId: string) => Promise<SessionLogoutResult>`- Log user out of Singpass session, using a valid session id (that is retrieved from Singpass domain cookie)
